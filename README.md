# Detecting Fake News with Python and Machine Learning

fake news is false information and hoaxes spread through social media and other online media to achieve a political agenda. In this data science project idea, will use Python to build a model that can accurately detect whether a piece of news is real or fake. Will build a TfidfVectorizer and use a PassiveAggressiveClassifier to classify news into “Real” and “Fake”. Using a dataset of shape 7796×4.
